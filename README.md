XBMC Plugins for Flingo TV support

- plugin.video.flingo is an addon that displays the user's Flingo queue
- script.service.flingo is a service that starts at user login and polls
  for "flings".  It can be configured to play a fling immediately, tell
  the user there is a new fling via dialog, or ignore the event silently.

Although these two addons can be used independently, it probably makes
more sense to install and enable them both together.

See http://flingo.tv for details.
